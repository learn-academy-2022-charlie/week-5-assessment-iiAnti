# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a hash in Ruby?

  Your answer:  hash in ruby is like a key value in react. You van make a bunch of keys with values and then call upon them. They can be changed as needed. There are two ways to write the hashes, one is to have the key and having it equal a value, and the other way is about the same as you would do in react, but without the state. You can use hashes to identify what you you are calling and what you want to name an object. Pretty much give it it's values and what it is.

  Researched answer: so hashed or mor eof and array. like an array, a hash can be iterated through, but it doesnt return the same way an arry does with index. It used objects instead.. It returns more randomly. they can be accessed and writen in may more ways than just two. The way to write a hash could be writen and understood in many differnet ways. All the keys are symbols which can be given a different value if so desired. Hte thing about hashes is that it;s a dtata structure whaich makes things a lot easier to read and understand what is happening.



2. What is a gem?

  Your answer: A gem is use to be able and run psql type of work. It is like a data package that allows you to run terminal and consoles to get facts and items from a chart of a certain variety, but in order for us to identify what is in the data chart and compare what we are trying to to achieve.

  Researched answer:  a gem has a name version and a platform, which is what defines what you'll be working in. The nive thing is that when updating or downloading a new gem, it will download the current one for whatever platform you are on. the gems have components of the the code, docs, and the gemspec. This includes what test and code you will be using, the supporting files, and what the gem mean(as in the verison and all that good stuff. it is yours specs as if you were looking at a car). the gems can be etiher for how the appp reacts, how we sign in, and all sorts of stuff including full stack dev.



3. What is Ruby on Rails?

  Your answer: Ruby on Rails is a testing framework we use tp test areas of a code or to test what would come of a certain call if we are trying to find the truth of a question. for ex. I used ruby on rails in a data chart. I had to try and find the area with the most population that exceeded X amount. I used the folder, names of the rows and WHERE this was greater than that. 

  Researched answer: So ror is a framework that helps us develope pages. though it can be used in testing what works and whats what, it has the properties to build. THis uses the MVC pattern which is what helps build out an app. This all stands for Model, which identifies how the program will be structured. Think of it as a UX design. like a wire frame in a sense. then we have the View which is how the actual app or webpage looks and interacts. After that, we have the final step which is control, which this controls the logic and what is going on behind the scenes of what you actually see.



4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer: Relational database is is what we use to find certain values within a dta chart. You can use  a calling to call all or just one of a matching pair wo what you called against.

  Researched answer: relational database have keys which identify what what is and what we may be looking for. they each have their own class and attributes that define what they have and what they are. So this is basically like when you are adding you address to yor accounts. the attributes are the street, city, state, zip. And you would look for you answer using those attributes or jsut one depending on what you might be looking for. Each one of these has a key. This is what it is defined as basically for simple understanding. You would need a the right key to know where something is or is going.



5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer: Primary keys are what define a row in a database. they are important so you can call upon a key to get all it's info. It's like a key value where you can call on the key and it will give you the value of the key. THen you select more from there wht you would like in a filtered search basically.

  Researched answer: I learned there are more then just an alternate key. BUt those other keys are known as alternate. they can consist of a natural key which is based on real word type of things while there are keys that fall out of a data base which is called a surrogate. A primary key though, is what can identify someone above all else. so this is giving everything it's unique identifier. This is important because there can be a csse where some attrivbutes may be the same in some areas, but will give you wthat uyou truly want will be the primary key. You can have to rows with the exact same everything, but the thing that will define what you are truly looking for will be the primary key. Like a Gamer-tag, if you already have the name, noone else can use it, but they can have the same everything else.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: restful routing uses CRUD actions to get a more organized way of getting a request. It will dislay what the HTTP call is doing so that we understand.

2. JSON: this stands for JS object notation. This stores data and whatever is being requested, and it representst the display of the what you are requesting. Basically the code.

3. ERB: this is a way of adding ruby to HTML. You can use ruby within HTML. Ruby will be evaluated anf then changed to fit into the HTML text format. 

4. Params: params is a short term for parameter methods. This gives a type for of a identifier for a search within a search bar.

5. API: this is where data from the user is being sent back and forth from a server and being interpreted to their own readable form. as for instance, the computer will read it in readable raw data and the user will receive it in the form of a GUI
